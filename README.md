# settlement-excel-regression-too

Planar tilt calculation example using Excel regression fit.

Note:
Stations must be evenly spaced around the bottom circumference of the tank and entered in order of angle from the point of origin.  There are n stations.

Data are entered in columns A and B only.  
Column A contains the station numbers 1 through n in order of distance from the point of origin clockwise around the perimeter of the tank.

Column B contains the measured elevations at the n stations.  The measurements can be expressed as elevations above or below an arbitrary datum (level plane); for example, the original plane of the tank bottom before settlement.
